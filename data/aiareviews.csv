25,"""I would advise using any other provider other than AIA as paying annual bills is almost impossible. They do not send invoices in a timely fashion and when you try contact them their resposnses are poor and unhelpful. After 10 emails and the submission multple direct debit authority forms I am still waiting for my premium payment to be processed. If they can't arrange to take your policy payment what hope have you got that AIA will actually process a claim. They are ill prepared to answer inquiries I asked 3 months before my anniversary date as to what my policy payment amount would be for the following year and they did not know. Further, they could not give me a billing date and they never sent an invoice prior to the bill due date. All this was after I had a direct debit in place and the funds available for payment a day before my policy anniversary date as I had no clear idea of when the policy payment was due having received no answer from them by phone or email.. Please take your money and seek insurance help elsewhere and if everyone does this then hopefully AIA will be out of business or at least wise up to the fact that some basic level of customer service is required. The web page is practically useless one should be able to login and see all one's policy details, get tax records, see invoices etc whenever one wants to!

Within a week of sending the documents to Donna, I received the funds in the bank and this helped me enormously the burden of the funeral expenses and other associated costs.

41,"""I held a Life and TPD policy with AIA and unfortunately had to make a claim on the TPD cover. The claims process was easy although my broker Insurance Watch helped immensely with this. Although the claim took just over a year to finalise, I do understand that this was likely due to the nature of my injury (psychiatric) and the need for it to be stable and stationary before assessment. Once the assessment took place, AIA was quite quick to respond and accept the claim. Payment was made within a day or so. Overall, I consider AIA was very good to deal with through the claims process and was very fair in assessing the claim. I did feel that they were here to help me, rather than find a way to deny a valid claim (which had been a concern I had at the start given an experience I had with a different insurer and a different type of claim)..""",2021-11-03,Sharon (QLD)

66,"""I was very healthy when I signed up. I was terminally ill with terminal heart failure, as diagnosed and documented by end stage heart failure team/ transplant team Acting Medical Director and heart transplant surgeon. I was terminally ill for about 2 weeks. Proof was provided. Weirdly I survived, and have received a gifted heart for which I am grateful every day. There was no possible way to predict this (no family history) and my claim for terminal illness and IP payments were both perfectly legitimate. I desperately want to return to work, but I will never be able to return to work full time. I should be insured for his, but my impression is that AIA only want to save as much money as possible by delaying my claim and only try to defend themselves to a very low standard in the AFCA Ombudsman cases. Heart transplants and mechanical hearts are, by definition, palliative interventions. They don't provide a cure, they just prolong life and never allow a full recovery. My main concern is the number of stroke events I have experienced already, and how this impacts my work capacity. Having a completely unsupportive insurer only adds to the stress, and this stress has immediately preceded two stroke events (I even had an alarm during a phone call with AIA claims assessor, and this was recorded and preceded a hospitalisation for a TiA by around a week). Please be careful when choosing any kind of life insurance product. You think you're buying assurance for your family, but you will not know if your insurer is any good until you make a claim. By then it's too late. AIA have had to pay extra benefits already and pay to meet a determination in my favour by AFCA. It has cost them more in AFCA fees than compensation to me, so they are wasting their shareholders' and policyholders money in fighting 'losing battles' in AFCA. I am now trying to have the rehabilitation benefits to pay for cardiac monitoring equipment for my fitness/ rehabilitation training and gym membership. AIA will almost certainly deny this and again spend more money fighting the case than they would to support my rehabilitation. I'm determined to return to work part time, based on medical advice. I'm not ready to be thrown on the scrap heap, but I will not be able to maximise my recovery without AIA's support. Do AIA want their clients to return to work and earn as much as possible, or not?.""",2020-12-16,Brett (NSW)
