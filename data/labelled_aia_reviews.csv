Heart transplants and mechanical hearts are, by definition, palliative interventions. They don't provide a cure, they just prolong life and never allow a full recovery. My main concern is the number of stroke events I have experienced already, and how this impacts my work capacity. Having a completely unsupportive insurer only adds to the stress, and this stress has immediately preceded two stroke events (I even had an alarm during a phone call with AIA claims assessor, and this was recorded and preceded a hospitalisation for a TiA by around a week). Please be careful when choosing any kind of life insurance product. You think you're buying assurance for your family, but you will not know if your insurer is any good until you make a claim. By then it's too late. AIA have had to pay extra benefits already and pay to meet a determination in my favour by AFCA. It has cost them more in AFCA fees than compensation to me, so they are wasting their shareholders' and policyholders money in fighting 'losing battles' in AFCA. I am now trying to have the rehabilitation benefits to pay for cardiac monitoring equipment for my fitness/ rehabilitation training and gym membership.
